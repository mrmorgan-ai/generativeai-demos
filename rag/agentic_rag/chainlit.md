Welcome to the Cardiology AI Assistant! This application is designed to help cardiologists and healthcare professionals access relevant information from multiple sources to make informed decisions about patient care.

## Features and Tools üõ†Ô∏è

This assistant has access to multiple knowledge sources through powerful Azure AI services:

### 1. Patient Data Access (NL2SQL)
- Query a patient database using natural language
- Access patient medical history, medications, and vital stats
- Secure, controlled access to patient information

### 2. ACC Guidelines Search (Azure AI Search)
- Access official American College of Cardiology (ACC) guidelines
- Evidence-based recommendations for cardiology practices
- Semantic search capabilities for accurate information retrieval

### 3. Real-Time Web Information (Azure AI Agent Service + Bing Web Grounding)
- Access the latest medical research and news via Bing Web Grounding
- Get up-to-date information about new treatments, FDA approvals, and more
- Powered by Azure AI Agent Service for comprehensive web search

## How to Use üöÄ

1. **Ask a question or make a request** related to cardiology, patient data, or medical information
2. The AI will **automatically choose which tools to use** based on your query
3. You'll see each step as the AI retrieves information and builds a response
4. The final answer will combine information from all relevant sources

## Example Queries üí¨

- "How many patients have Hypertension and are prescribed Lisinopril?"
- "What does the ACC recommend as first-line therapy for hypertension in elderly patients?"
- "Are there any recent updates in 2025 on new anticoagulant therapies from the FDA?"
- "I have a 79-year-old patient named Gloria Paul with hyperlipidemia. She's on Atorvastatin. Can you confirm her medical details from the database, check the ACC guidelines for hyperlipidemia, and see if there are any new medication updates from the FDA as of Feb 2025? Then give me a summary."
